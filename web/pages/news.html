	<p>
		Ready for the Honeynet Project Meeting in February, we are pleased to
		announce our second release of HoneyProxy!<br> This release features a
		new Report Editor which allows you to analyze your flows, aggregate
		data or search for anomalies in your traffic dumps. It is our first
		independent release after Google Summer of Code 2012 and I'm happy to
		say that HoneyProxy has grown steadily over the last months.
